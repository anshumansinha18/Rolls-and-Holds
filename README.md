# Rolls-and-Holds
'Rolls and Holds' is a cool game developed using JavaScript with beautiful UI designed using CSS.

Rules of the game are like this:
   1. A player keeps throwing a dice until he gets 1.
   2. Before getting 1, if a player holds: 
         (i) then all the numbers appeared so far on the dice are accumulated and added to his score.
         (ii) and then control is transferred to second player.
   3. If player1 doesn't holds and he scores 1, then his current scores become zero, then the next player is given chance to do the same.
   4. At the end whoever has a score more than or equal to 100 wins.
